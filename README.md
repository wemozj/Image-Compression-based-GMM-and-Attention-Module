## Overview
Pytorch code of our recent work [A Unified End-to-End Framework for Efficient Deep Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03370).

This repo also contains the reimplementation for [Variational image compression with a scale hyperprior](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01436).

## Prerequisites

You should install the libraries of this repo.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

We need to first prepare the training and validation data.
The trainging data is from flicker.com.
You can obtain the training data according to description of [CompressionData](https://github.com/liujiaheng/CompressionData).

The validation data is the popular kodak dataset.
```
bash data/download_kodak.sh
```

## Training 

For high bitrate (4096, 6144, 8192), the out_channel_N is 192 and the out_channel_M is 320 in 'config_high.json'.
For low bitrate (256, 512, 1024, 2048), the out_channel_N is 128 and the out_channel_M is 192 in 'config_low.json'.

### Details
For high bitrate of 8192, we first train from scratch as follows.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --config examples/example/config_high.json -n baseline_8192 --train flicker_path --val kodak_path
```
For other high bitrate (4096, 6144), we use the converged model of 8192 as pretrain model and set the learning rate as 1e-5.
The training iterations are set as 500000.

The low bitrate (256, 512, 1024, 2048) training process follows the same strategy.
